# Enhanced Shape Library & PNG/JPG Export - Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing two major features:
1. Enhanced Shape Library System with categorization and lazy loading
2. PNG/JPG Export functionality with quality options

## Feature 1: Enhanced Shape Library System

### Functional Requirements

#### FR1.1 Shape Categorization
- **REQ-SL-001**: System SHALL organize shapes into logical categories (Networking, Cloud, People, Basic, Containers, Database, Security, etc.)
- **REQ-SL-002**: Each category SHALL contain 15-25 professionally designed shapes
- **REQ-SL-003**: System SHALL support easy addition of new categories and shapes
- **REQ-SL-004**: All existing shapes SHALL remain accessible and functional

#### FR1.2 Lazy Loading System
- **REQ-SL-005**: Shape categories SHALL load only when accessed by user
- **REQ-SL-006**: Initial application load SHALL NOT be impacted by additional shapes
- **REQ-SL-007**: Shape loading SHALL provide visual feedback (loading indicators)
- **REQ-SL-008**: Previously loaded categories SHALL be cached for session

#### FR1.3 User Interface
- **REQ-SL-009**: Shape library panel SHALL display categories in tabbed or accordion interface
- **REQ-SL-010**: Users SHALL be able to search across all categories
- **REQ-SL-011**: Recently used shapes SHALL be easily accessible
- **REQ-SL-012**: Category icons SHALL be intuitive and recognizable

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR1.1 Performance
- **REQ-SL-013**: Category switching SHALL complete within 200ms
- **REQ-SL-014**: Shape loading SHALL not block UI interactions
- **REQ-SL-015**: Memory usage SHALL not increase by more than 50MB during normal operation

#### NFR1.2 Compatibility
- **REQ-SL-016**: New system SHALL be backward compatible with existing diagrams
- **REQ-SL-017**: Existing shape definitions SHALL work without modification
- **REQ-SL-018**: System SHALL work across all supported browsers

## Feature 2: PNG/JPG Export System

### Functional Requirements

#### FR2.1 Export Formats
- **REQ-EX-001**: System SHALL support PNG export with transparency
- **REQ-EX-002**: System SHALL support JPG export with configurable quality (60-100%)
- **REQ-EX-003**: Users SHALL be able to choose between current viewport or full diagram export
- **REQ-EX-004**: Export SHALL maintain original aspect ratios and styling

#### FR2.2 Quality & Options
- **REQ-EX-005**: PNG exports SHALL support transparency preservation
- **REQ-EX-006**: JPG quality SHALL be selectable in 10% increments
- **REQ-EX-007**: Export resolution SHALL be configurable (1x, 2x, 3x scaling)
- **REQ-EX-008**: Background color SHALL be configurable for non-transparent exports

#### FR2.3 User Experience
- **REQ-EX-009**: Export dialog SHALL provide preview of export area
- **REQ-EX-010**: Large exports SHALL show progress indication
- **REQ-EX-011**: Export SHALL complete within reasonable time (< 30 seconds for typical diagrams)
- **REQ-EX-012**: System SHALL handle export errors gracefully with user feedback

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR2.1 Performance
- **REQ-EX-013**: Export SHALL not freeze the UI during processing
- **REQ-EX-014**: Memory usage during export SHALL not exceed 200MB for typical diagrams
- **REQ-EX-015**: Export quality SHALL be comparable to native screenshot tools

#### NFR2.2 Reliability
- **REQ-EX-016**: Export SHALL work consistently across different diagram sizes
- **REQ-EX-017**: System SHALL recover gracefully from export failures
- **REQ-EX-018**: Large diagram exports SHALL not cause browser crashes

## Technical Constraints

### TC1: Performance Constraints
- Total bundle size increase SHALL not exceed 500KB
- Initial load time SHALL not increase by more than 100ms
- Runtime memory usage SHALL not exceed current baseline by more than 25%

### TC2: Browser Compatibility
- Features SHALL work on Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- Mobile browser support is optional but preferred

### TC3: Integration Constraints
- Changes SHALL not break existing functionality
- API changes SHALL be backward compatible
- New features SHALL integrate cleanly with existing codebase architecture

## Success Criteria

### Shape Library Success Metrics
- User can access 100+ professionally designed shapes
- Category switching completes in under 200ms
- Shape search returns results in under 100ms
- Zero performance regression in diagram editing

### Export Success Metrics
- PNG export with transparency works correctly
- JPG export with selectable quality (60-100%) works correctly
- Export time for typical diagrams under 5 seconds
- Zero data loss during export process

## Out of Scope

### V1.0 Exclusions
- Real-time collaborative features
- Cloud storage integration for shapes
- Custom shape creation tools
- Animated GIF export
- Vector format exports (SVG, PDF)
- Batch export functionality
- Shape marketplace or sharing features
